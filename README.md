# Console-Finances
JavaScript Console Finances Report

## Description 
This webpage contains information on a log of finances. Required information is stored within the console. The aim was to find the total number of months and net total amount of loses/profits from the data set which has been achieved. Further requirements included finding average changes in profits/loses, greatest increase in profit and greatest decrease in loses which has not yet been achieved. Through this project, I have developed my understanding of arrays, javaScript basics and variables. Moving forward, I will repair the errors for the last two parts of the task. 

## Installation

To work on this code copy this SSH key: git@github.com:chelsea32568/Console-Finances.git and paste into your desired folder using Git Bash. Then use git pull to pull the file into your local repository. Make necessary changes and then add changes into the git repository by using git add -A, git commit -m "", git push. 

## Usage
